# AllergyDotNet

Welcome to the AllergyDotNet project! This repository contains the code and resources for a web application and a mobile application designed to simplify and alleviate the worries of individuals living with allergies.

## Project Objectives

The objective of the AllergyDotNet project is to simplify and alleviate the lives of allergy sufferers by providing the following features:

1. **Simplifying and Alleviating Allergy Management:** Our project aims to simplify and alleviate the worries and anxieties faced by individuals with allergies. By providing a user-friendly interface and valuable resources, we strive to make allergy management more manageable and less stressful.

2. **Access to Allergen Information:** We understand the importance of having access to reliable information about allergens, their prevalence, and locations. Our applications provide a centralized hub where users can find up-to-date data on allergens, helping them make informed decisions and avoid potential triggers.

3. **Consultations with Allergists:** We recognize the value of connecting allergy sufferers with experienced allergists. Our project offers a platform where users can seek consultations with allergists based on their profile information. This personalized approach allows allergists to track and monitor the patient's condition, providing tailored advice and recommendations.

## Applications

It provides an intuitive interface for accessing allergen information, managing allergies, and scheduling consultations with allergists.

- **Mobile Application:** You can watch a demo of the mobile application [here](https://youtu.be/mcnvJxYJDGo). The mobile application is specifically designed for users to access allergen information, receive notifications, and manage their allergies on the go.

Thank you for your interest from the AllergyDotNet development team!

The development of AllergyDotNet aimed to simplify and improve the lives of allergy sufferers. We believe that providing access to information about allergens, their prevalence, and locations, as well as offering consultations with experienced allergists, can help individuals better manage their condition and alleviate unnecessary worries.
